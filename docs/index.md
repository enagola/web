
# Introduction
<p> The purpose of this project is to build and develop a robot with capilities so that it can support and help human in daily tasks. Originally from the movie Star War, our Robot takes inluence from the robot BB-8, which is a smart Robots that can interact with humans. Our project, the robot known as RD-1, is a self-balancing robot that has the goal of assisting our everyday retrieval needs. The goal of the project is to have RD-1 be able to listen to commands from people similar to that of Google, Siri, and Alexa, and be able to interpret that command in orderto complete a task.  Some general tasks that the robot will be able to do is interact with a user,recognize objects, move on its own, and be aware of its overall surroundings.  With these general tasks the robot will be able to take simple commands of retrieval, locate objects that were requested and move to the objects.  After being able to do that, the robot will expand towards being able to pick up those objects, locate the person who requested it, and bring the object to him. The project is completed at University of California, San Diego during Spring 2021.</p>

# Background
<p> Robots nowadays play an important role in any life aspect. They reshape the way we do tedious tasks. However, they still have limits when human still need to have physical control to the robot. Because of this, our group is determined to build an low cost and efficient robot that can recognize the most fast protocol - voice command, and run on its own to a target to do that specific task from users. Our method will use Voice Recognition, Object Detection, and Planning Motion libraries running on Raspberry Pi 4 and Adruino.</p>


# Abstract
We are using a self-balancing robot called ELEGOO, which is a pre existing robot and we design to use various hardwares such as  cameras, speakers, microphones and other listening devices to help us accomplish our goal and make better use of robot's capabilities. We are going to use the arduino to balance the robot and a raspberry pi to get the RD-1 to use voice and object recognition. We will be using packages from python , Arduino IDE, and voice recognition libraries  such as google API to help us create machine learning algorithms that uses computer vision like OpenCV and voice recognition similar to google, siri, and Alexa. We will also create a neural networks with the intention to give the robot a way for it to learn and adapt in different scenarios that could potentially be prsented when put into use. With this software we hope to accomplish the robot’s ability to rotate its camera and move around on its own, recognize objects that it’s camera picks up as it moves around, be able to turn speech into words it can understand, and be able to execute simple commands from those words.

# Motivation/Goal

Our motivation for this project is to create a smart robot(AI), in this case using ELEGOO, to then create our fully equipeed RD-1 with the hardware mentioned previuisly. Our motivation to create this type of RD-1 robot is because we want to create AI use in every day life more practical since we feel like it's not being used as much as it should be currently in the state of this world. The use of AI right now seems to be used in the more complex problems of the world and its usually found in Marketing, FInance, HealthCare , etc so there isn't much use of AI use in everyday life task since its mostly use in big industries. We are motivated to target people life with this robot because it can also benefit people that are limited to what they can do such as handicapped people that might have troubke moving around or pickig up different items ariund their home and can also benefit people in nursing homes accomplish simple different task that might presentsitself.So our goal with this project is to integrate  RD-1 into person's everyday life to accomplish simple task for them and this can be possible with the use of RD-1 since it will able to to recognize speech commands given by a person and execute the command safely and efficiently.
